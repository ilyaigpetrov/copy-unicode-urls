# Copy Unicode URLs

## Stores

| Browser | Store |
|----------------|------|
|Chrome/Chromium | https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-unicode-urls/fnbbfiapefhkicjhecnoepbijhanpkjp |
|FireFox | https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-unicode-urls/|

On FireFox there is a special option `browser.urlbar.decodeURLsOnCopy` accessible at `about:config` that decodes url on copy. If you want to save some resources then it may be enough for you. Keep in mind that this option is [different in behaviour](https://github.com/ilyaigpetrov/copy-unicode-urls/issues/22) from the extension.

## Offline

Packages for offline installation may be found at [releases page](https://github.com/ilyaigpetrov/copy-unicode-urls/releases):

1) Download a zip file.
2) Unpack it to a folder.
3) Visit chrome://extensions, switch on developer mode.
4) Press "Load unpacked" and point to the folder with unpacked extension.

If extension is installed this way (from file system, not from webstore) then it won't automatically update when new version is published to webstore. You have to update extension manually by reinstalling it from a new package from the releases page.
